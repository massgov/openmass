## [0.316.0] - March 15, 2022

### Added
  - DP-22908: Adding parent breadcrumb feature.
  - DP-23089: Added "Parent page" and "Short title" fields to content types.
  - DP-23302: Added validation to nodes to only allow nodes without children to be unpublished or trashed.
  - DP-23335: Added a module to automatically assign parent relationships.
  - DP-23356: Adds functionality to move direct children to another parent.
  - DP-23360: Display current breadcrumb for authors below the parent field.
  - DP-23411: - Patches core tabledrag.js to store its object on the table data, to
  allow later append rows asynchronously.
- Patches entity_hierarchy based on another patch which allowed to see
  node hierarchies, reorder and save. However, the original patch loaded
  all the tree, causing memory and processing issues. The current patch
  against entity_hierarchy loads second level and beyond asynchronously,
  and also saves hierarchy information only when parent changes, ommiting
  the weight.
- Adds js/hierarchy-node-form.js to handle expansion and async loading.
- Adds css/overrides/hierarchy-node-form.css.
  - DP-23499: Update display of current breadcrumb for authors below the parent field to use short title if exists.

  - DP-23572: Added an Updated date field to the Event content type and migrated the node changed date into the field.
