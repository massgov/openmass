## [0.454.0] - October 14, 2025

### Added
  - DP-42311: Add disclaimer field to AI Content Advisor Config
  
### Changed
  - DP-42562: Updated form inventory report
  
### Fixed
  - DP-42577: URL entered by author is cleaned, rendering it broken
  - DP-42632: Restore collection visibility for Authors and Editors by re-adding the "access taxonomy overview" permission that was removed in DP-39524. To prevent these roles from seeing the Taxonomy tab in the Content menu, created a new "access taxonomy dashboard menu" permission that controls visibility of the Taxonomy menu item separately from the ability to view taxonomy terms in entity reference fields.
