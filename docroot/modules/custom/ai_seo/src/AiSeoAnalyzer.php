8.  **[Keyword: URL Optimization] URL Structure (Conciseness, Readability, Keywords):**

    *   **Scrutiny of URL Elements:** Examine URLs for conciseness, readability for users and search engines, and inclusion of relevant keywords.
    *   **Definitive URL Improvement Proposals:**  Propose specific, improved URL structures that are SEO-friendly (keyword-rich, short, descriptive) and user-friendly (understandable, memorable).
    *   **URL SEO Benefit (Clarity & Relevance Signals):** Explain how optimized URLs contribute to SEO by providing clear signals to search engines about page content and improving user understanding and memorability.

9.  **[Keyword: Drupal Performance] Mobile Responsiveness & Load Time (Drupal-Specific Focus):**

        *   **Subtopic Deepening:** Identify specific subtopics or related concepts within the existing content that could be expanded upon to provide more in-depth coverage.
        *   **Data & Evidence Integration:** Recommend specific types of data, statistics, examples, or sources that could be integrated to strengthen the factual basis and authority of the content.
    *   **Content Format Diversification (Where Applicable):** Suggest exploring alternative content formats to enhance depth and engagement (e.g., 'Consider supplementing the text with an infographic to visually explain complex data,' 'Suggest creating a short video summarizing the key takeaways,' 'Explore embedding an interactive tool or calculator relevant to the topic').
    *   **Author/Source Credibility Enhancement (If Possible within HTML Context):** If the HTML provides author information, suggest ways to strengthen the perceived credibility of the author or source (e.g., 'If an author bio is present, ensure it highlights relevant expertise and credentials,' 'If the content is attributed to an organization, emphasize their authority in the field').

3.  **Justification - SEO and User Benefit of Topic Authority:**

    *   **Explain SEO Importance:** Clearly articulate *why* enhancing topic authority is critical for SEO performance in today's search landscape.  Specifically address:

**Objective:** Assume the role of a Content Readability and Natural Language SEO Specialist. Your task is to conduct a focused "Detailed Content Analysis" of the provided HTML page content, specifically evaluating its **Natural Language Use**.  The primary goal is to assess the content\'s readability, conversational tone, and seamless integration of keywords, and to recommend actionable improvements that enhance user engagement and usability in search, particularly in generative search results.

        *   **Sentence Variety & Rhythm:** Is there variety in sentence structure to maintain reader interest and avoid monotony?
        *   **Engagement Techniques:** Are there elements that encourage user engagement (e.g., rhetorical questions, calls to action – though focus primarily on *tone* for this section)?
    *   **Keyword Integration Naturalness:**  Analyze how keywords are integrated into the text.

  public function getHeadingsAndStructurePrompt() {
    return $this->t('**Objective:** Assume the role of an On-Page SEO and Content Structure Specialist. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive "Keywords and Structure SEO Audit" of the provided HTML page content.  The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of keyword usage within the content\'s structure (headings) and body text, and to assess the overall hierarchical organization, delivering actionable recommendations to optimize both for improved search engine ranking and user experience.

**Context:** You are analyzing the textual content and HTML heading tags of a webpage (provided separately). Your focus is strictly limited to **keyword integration within the content structure and the hierarchical organization of the content** itself.  Disregard other SEO elements for this focused analysis.

**Instructions:**

Perform a detailed analysis of the HTML page content, specifically evaluating the following aspects related to Keywords and Structure:

1.  **Current State Assessment - Heading Structure and Hierarchy:**

    *   **Examine Heading Hierarchy (H1-H6):** Assess the use of heading tags (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6) within the HTML. Consider:
        *   **Logical Hierarchy:** Is there a clear and logical hierarchical structure to the headings, reflecting the content\'s organization? Does it follow a natural flow from main topics to subtopics and sub-subtopics?
        *   **Appropriate Heading Tag Usage:** Are heading tags used correctly to denote structural importance (H1 for main topic, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections, etc.)?
        *   **Avoidance of Heading Skipping or Misuse:** Are heading tags used consistently and avoid skipping levels (e.g., jumping from H2 to H4) or misusing them for stylistic purposes rather than structural significance?
    *   **Evaluate Heading Descriptive Nature and Keyword Richness:** Analyze the content of the heading tags themselves. Consider:
        *   **Descriptive Headings:** Are headings clear, concise, and descriptive of the content within each section? Do they accurately summarize the topic of the following text?
        *   **Keyword Relevance in Headings:**  Are relevant primary and secondary keywords naturally incorporated into heading tags where contextually appropriate?
        *   **Avoidance of Keyword Stuffing in Headings:** Are headings optimized for keywords in a natural way, or do they appear overly stuffed with keywords, sacrificing readability?

2.  **Current State Assessment - Keyword Integration in Body Text (Context & Density - as a signal within structure):**

    *   **Evaluate Keyword Density and Contextual Relevance (within structured sections):** Assess the integration of primary and secondary keywords within the body text *underneath each heading*.  Consider:
        *   **Keyword Density within Sections:** While density is not the primary focus, get a sense of keyword presence within each content section.  Is there a general presence of relevant keywords within the text under each heading? (Note: Do not rigidly calculate density at this stage, focus on *impression* of keyword integration within context.)
        *   **Contextual Keyword Use:** Are keywords used in a contextually relevant and meaningful way within the body text sections? Do they naturally fit within the sentences and paragraphs?
        *   **Varied Keyword Usage:** Is there a variation in keyword usage (e.g., use of synonyms, related terms) or is it overly repetitive and reliant on exact match keywords?
    *   **Assess Keyword Placement within Structured Content:** Analyze the strategic placement of keywords within the structured content. Consider:
        *   **Keywords in Key Structural Areas:** Are primary and secondary keywords strategically included in important structural areas such as:
            *   **H1 Heading:** Is the primary keyword present in the main H1 heading?
            *   **Initial Paragraphs of Sections:** Are keywords introduced early within the first few sentences of sections under each heading?
            *   **Concluding Paragraphs of Sections:** Are keywords reinforced or naturally summarized in the concluding sentences of sections?

3.  **Actionable Improvement Recommendations - Enhancing Keywords and Structure:**

    *   **Heading Structure Enhancement Strategies:** Propose concrete, actionable strategies to improve the heading structure and hierarchy. Be specific. Examples:
        *   **Heading Hierarchy Revisions:** Suggest specific revisions to the heading hierarchy to create a more logical and user-friendly content outline (e.g., "Demote H2 \'X\' to H3 under H2 \'Y\' as it\'s a subtopic," "Introduce an H2 heading \'Z\' to break up the long section under \'A\'").
        *   **Heading Rewrites for Keyword and Clarity:** Provide examples of rewritten headings that are more descriptive, keyword-rich (where appropriate and natural), and user-friendly.
        *   **Content Reorganization Suggestions:**  If the current structure is weak, suggest broader content reorganization strategies to improve flow and logic, reflected in the headings.
    *   **Keyword Integration Strategy within Structure:** Provide actionable recommendations for improving keyword integration within the content\'s structural framework. Examples:
        *   **Keyword Insertion in Headings (Where Missing and Relevant):** Suggest specific headings where primary or secondary keywords could be naturally incorporated.
        *   **Strategic Keyword Placement Guidance for Body Text:** Provide guidance on where and how to strategically integrate keywords within the body text *under each heading* (e.g., "Ensure the primary keyword appears in the first sentence of the section under H2 \'B\'").
        *   **Keyword Variation and LSI Keyword Use:** Recommend incorporating keyword variations and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords within the headings and body text to broaden topical coverage and improve natural language flow.

4.  **Justification - SEO and User Benefit of Keywords and Structure:**

    *   **Explain SEO Benefits of Heading Structure & Keywords:** Clearly articulate *why* effective heading structure and strategic keyword use within structure are crucial for SEO performance. Specifically address:
        *   **Signaling Content Topic & Hierarchy to Search Engines:** Explain how headings and keyword usage within them help search engines understand the topic, subtopics, and hierarchical organization of the page content.
        *   **Keyword Relevance Signals:** Discuss how keywords in headings and strategically placed within the text under headings reinforce topical relevance signals to search engines.
        *   **Improved Crawlability & Indexing:** Explain how a clear heading structure can improve crawlability and indexing by making it easier for search engines to understand the content\'s organization.
    *   **Explain User Benefits of Heading Structure & Keywords:** Clearly articulate *how* effective heading structure and keyword use enhance user experience. Specifically address:
        *   **Improved Readability & Scanability:** Explain how clear headings make content more readable and scannable, allowing users to quickly grasp the main points and find information.
        *   **Enhanced User Navigation & Understanding:** Discuss how a logical heading structure improves user navigation through the content and aids in overall comprehension of the topic.
        *   **Meeting User Search Intent (Implicitly through relevant keywords):** Explain how incorporating relevant keywords in headings helps to align the content with user search intent and increases the likelihood of attracting the right audience.
