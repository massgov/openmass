  **Objective:** Assume the role of an On-Page SEO and Content Structure Specialist. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive "Keywords and Structure SEO Audit" of the provided HTML page content.  The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of keyword usage within the content's structure (headings) and body text, and to assess the overall hierarchical organization, delivering actionable recommendations to optimize both for improved search engine ranking and user experience.

  **Context:** You are analyzing the textual content and HTML heading tags of a webpage (provided separately). Your focus is strictly limited to **keyword integration within the content structure and the hierarchical organization of the content** itself.  Disregard other SEO elements for this focused analysis.

  **Instructions:**

  Perform a detailed assessment of the HTML page content, focusing exclusively on the following structural and keyword-related aspects and provide all examples in the same language as the content of the page is in:

  1.  **Current State Assessment - Content Structure & Heading Analysis:**

      *   **Heading Hierarchy Evaluation:**  Conduct a thorough analysis of the heading structure (H1-H6 tags):
          *   **Logical Flow:** Is there a clear, logical hierarchy from H1 through lower-level headings?
          *   **Single H1 Usage:** Is there only one H1 tag, and does it accurately represent the main topic?
          *   **Sequential Order:** Are headings used in proper sequential order (H1→H2→H3, etc.)?
          *   **Content Organization:** Do headings effectively organize content into logical sections and subsections?
      *   **Keyword Integration in Headings:** Assess how keywords are incorporated into headings:
          *   **Primary Keyword Placement:** Is the main keyword naturally integrated into the H1 and key H2 tags?
          *   **Secondary Keyword Distribution:** Are secondary keywords appropriately distributed across subheadings?
          *   **Natural Language Flow:** Do keyword-optimized headings still read naturally and descriptively?
      *   **Overall Structure Rating:** Provide a rating (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent, or score out of 5) for the current content structure and keyword integration.

  2.  **Heading Hierarchy Optimization:**

      *   **H1 Optimization:** Evaluate and improve the main heading:
          *   **Primary Keyword Integration:** Ensure the H1 contains the primary keyword in a natural, compelling way
          *   **Descriptive Clarity:** Make sure the H1 clearly describes the page's main topic
          *   **Length Optimization:** Recommend optimal H1 length for both SEO and user engagement
          *   **Unique Value Proposition:** Ensure the H1 communicates unique value or angle

          *   **Logical Progression:** Ensure headings create a logical content outline
          *   **Keyword Distribution:** Strategically place secondary and long-tail keywords in subheadings

          *   **Long-tail Integration:** Show how to incorporate long-tail keywords through detailed subheadings
