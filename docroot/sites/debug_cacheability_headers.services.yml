# Enable cache tag debugging headers. These are used in some tests, and are
# useful when debugging caches.
# Pages with many cache tags (such as node forms with many paragraphs) may
# hit the default Apache header limit of 16KB. If pages mysteriously
# crash with this setting enabled, increase LimitRequestFieldSize in the
# Apache configuration.
