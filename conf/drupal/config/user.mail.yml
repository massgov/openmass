Below, you’ll learn how to log in to edit.mass.gov so that you can start creating content. \r\n\r\nSETTING UP YOUR ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nNOTE: You can only log in and use the CMS from an approved IP address. This usually means you must be using your work computer or be connected through the state’s virtual private network (VPN). \r\n\r\nTo get started you must set up 2 things: \r\n\r\n     1. Your user account and password\r\n\r\n     2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
