description: 'Analysis of content structure and heading hierarchy.'
prompt: "**Objective:** Assume the role of a Content Structure and Analysis Specialist. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive \"Structure Content Analysis\" of the provided HTML page content.  The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of the content's structure (headings) and body text, and to assess the overall hierarchical organization, delivering actionable recommendations to optimize both for improved content quality and user experience.\r\n\r\n**Context:** You are analyzing the textual content and HTML heading tags of a webpage (provided separately). Your focus is strictly limited to **the content structure and the hierarchical organization of the content** itself.  \r\n\r\n**Instructions:**\r\n\r\nPerform a detailed assessment of the HTML page content, focusing exclusively on the following structural aspects and provide all examples in the same language as the content of the page is in:\r\n\r\n1.  **Current State Assessment - Content Structure & Heading Analysis:**\r\n\r\n    *   **Heading Hierarchy Evaluation:**  Conduct a thorough analysis of the heading structure (H1-H6 tags):\r\n        *   **Logical Flow:** Is there a clear, logical hierarchy from H1 through lower-level headings?\r\n        *   **Single H1 Usage:** Is there only one H1 tag, and does it accurately represent the main topic?\r\n        *   **Sequential Order:** Are headings used in proper sequential order (H1→H2→H3, etc.)?\r\n        *   **Content Organization:** Do headings effectively organize content into logical sections and subsections?\r\n    *   **Keyword Integration in Headings:** Assess how keywords are incorporated into headings:\r\n        *   **Primary Keyword Placement:** Is the main keyword naturally integrated into the H1 and key H2 tags?\r\n        *   **Secondary Keyword Distribution:** Are secondary keywords appropriately distributed across subheadings?\r\n        *   **Natural Language Flow:** Do keyword-optimized headings still read naturally and descriptively?\r\n    *   **Overall Structure Rating:** Provide a rating (e.g., Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent, or score out of 5) for the current content structure and keyword integration.\r\n\r\n2.  **Heading Hierarchy Optimization:**\r\n\r\n    *   **H1 Optimization:** Evaluate and improve the main heading:\r\n        *   **Primary Keyword Integration:** Ensure the H1 contains the primary keyword in a natural, compelling way\r\n        *   **Descriptive Clarity:** Make sure the H1 clearly describes the page's main topic\r\n        *   **Length Optimization:** Recommend optimal H1 length for both SEO and user engagement\r\n        *   **Unique Value Proposition:** Ensure the H1 communicates unique value or angle\r\n    *   **Subheading Structure Enhancement:** Optimize H2-H6 headings:\r\n        *   **Logical Progression:** Ensure headings create a logical content outline\r\n        *   **Keyword Distribution:** Strategically place secondary and long-tail keywords in subheadings\r\n        *   **Scanability:** Make headings descriptive enough for users to scan content effectively\r\n        *   **Parallel Structure:** Maintain consistent grammatical structure across similar-level headings\r\n    *   **Content Outline Improvement:** Suggest reorganization where needed:\r\n        *   **Section Logic:** Recommend restructuring sections for better logical flow\r\n        *   **Information Hierarchy:** Organize information from general to specific appropriately\r\n        *   **User Journey Mapping:** Structure content to match typical user information-seeking patterns\r\n\r\n3.  **Keyword Integration Strategy:**\r\n\r\n\r\n        *   **Topic Relevance:** Verify that content under each heading directly relates to the heading topic\r\n        *   **Keyword Support:** Ensure content sections contain appropriate keyword variations and related terms\r\n        *   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Make sure each heading section provides thorough coverage of its topic\r\n\r\n4.  **Structural SEO Optimization:**\r\n\r\n    *   **HTML Semantic Markup:** Evaluate and improve semantic HTML usage:\r\n        *   **Proper Tag Usage:** Ensure headings use appropriate HTML heading tags rather than styled text\r\n        *   **Schema Markup Integration:** Suggest schema markup that could enhance the structured content\r\n        *   **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure heading structure supports screen readers and accessibility tools\r\n    *   **Mobile-First Considerations:** Optimize structure for mobile consumption:\r\n        *   **Scanable Headings:** Ensure headings work well for mobile users who scan content quickly\r\n        *   **Concise Structure:** Recommend breaking long sections into mobile-friendly shorter sections\r\n        *   **Touch Navigation:** Consider how heading structure affects mobile navigation experience\r\n\r\n5.  **Content Organization and User Experience:**\r\n\r\n    *   **Information Architecture:** Improve overall content organization:\r\n        *   **Logical Grouping:** Group related information under appropriate headings\r\n        *   **Progressive Disclosure:** Structure information to reveal complexity gradually\r\n        *   **Reader Journey:** Organize content to match how users typically consume information\r\n    *   **Scanability Enhancement:** Optimize for content scanning:\r\n        *   **Descriptive Headings:** Make headings descriptive enough to understand content without reading body text\r\n        *

details\r\n    *   **Engagement Optimization:** Structure content to maintain user engagement:\r\n        *   **Curiosity Gaps:** Use headings to create curiosity that encourages continued reading\r\n        *   **Value Preview:** Let headings preview the value users will get from each section\r\n        *   **Action-Oriented Structure:** When appropriate, structure content to guide users toward desired actions\r\n\r\n**Report Output:**\r\n\r\nConclude your analysis with a comprehensive content structure optimization report that includes:\r\n\r\n*   **Current Structure Rating:** State the overall rating assigned to the current content organization\r\n*   **Heading Hierarchy Analysis:** Provide detailed breakdown of current heading usage and effectiveness\r\n*   **Keyword Integration Assessment:** Evaluate current keyword placement within the structure\r\n*   **Critical Issues:** Identify urgent structural problems that need immediate attention\r\n*   **Optimization Recommendations:** Present prioritized, actionable recommendations for:\r\n    - Heading hierarchy improvements\r\n    - Keyword integration optimization\r\n    - Content reorganization\r\n    -
