description: "If you want this organization's content to appear in a filtered search within a parent organization, choose the parent organization. You should only enter the parent that is directly above the current organization. For example, for the Bureau of Health Professions Licensure within the Department of Public Health, enter the Department of Public Health as the parent organization on the bureau's org page.  If you want the Bureau of Health Professions Licensure content to also appear in a search of the executive office that oversees the department, you would also need to select the Executive Office of Health and Human Services as the parent on the org page of the Department of Public Health."
