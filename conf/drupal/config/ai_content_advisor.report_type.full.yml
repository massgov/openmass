prompt: "Read through the entirety of the page. \r\n\r\nGuidelines:\r\n1. The content of the web page should be good enough to reduce the need for visitors to contact the state unless the page explicitly encourages it. Because of this, you should not suggest that contact information be more prominent unless soliciting that contact is a clear objective of the page.\r\n2. The state has decided not to label links to other sites as external links that leave Mass.gov because many sites are government affiliated and this may cause confusion. Do not report any recommendation related to labeling external links.\r\n3. Ignore the HTML title tag as this will not be accurate in the page you review.\r\n\r\nNote any MAJOR, MODERATE, or MINOR problems you identify only on your scratch pad, it is okay if there are none, just say so. Do not include trivial problems. Use a header \"Thinking\" for this scratch pad. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nOnce the above has been completed, and in under 3000 characters, Created a numbered List with only the recommendations that will fix the MAJOR or MODERATE problems that appear in your scratch pad analysis in a numbered list. Do not include recommendations for any MINOR problems. Explain exactly what specific changes you recommend. Make sure that these recommendations don't violate any of the Guidelines listed above. Use a header \"Recommendations\" for this section and order them with the most important recommendations first.\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n<h2>Thinking</h2>\r\n1. [problem description] ([Major, Moderate, Minor])\r\n2. ...\r\n3....\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n1. [specific recommendation here that clearly states what exactly should change and what it should be changed to]"
