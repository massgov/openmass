    body: "Dear [user:display-name],\r\n\r\nThank you for setting up two-factor authentication (also known as multifactor authentication) on your account at edit.mass.gov. Please remember that you will need your authentication method (your cell phone or desktop software) ready every time you log in. \r\n\r\nIf you lose your device, you can use one of your recovery codes to log in. Then you can disable your existing two-factor setup and re-enable two-factor with a new device. If you have not taken note of your recovery codes, please do so the next time you log in. Store them in a safe place! \r\n\r\n-- Massachusetts Digital Service "
