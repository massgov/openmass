prompt: "Constraints (do not violate):\r\n\r\n1. Do not recommend making contact info more prominent unless encouraging contact is an explicit page goal.\r\n\r\n2. Do not recommend labeling external links as “external.”\r\n\r\n3. Read through the entirety of the page. \r\n\r\n\r\nConstraints (do not violate):\r\n1. Do not recommend that external links be labelled as external links.\r\n2. Do make recommendations related to a table of contents. It may be empty and you can assume that it is populated after page load and links to each H2 section. \r\n3. Do not make recommendations related to the the header, footer, global navigation (with id \"main-navigation\"), and the feedback form at the bottom of the page (id of \"feedback\"). Do not report issues for the header, footer, global navigation, or feedback components.\r\n4. Do not recommend that contact information should be more prominent unless soliciting that contact is a clear objective of the page.\r\n\r\nNote any MAJOR, MODERATE, MINOR, or TRIVIAL problems you identify only on your scratch pad, it is okay if there are none, just say so. Use a header \"Thinking\" for this scratch pad. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nOnce the above has been completed, and in under 6000 characters, Created a numbered List with only the recommendations that will fix the MAJOR, MODERATE, or MINOR problems that appear in your scratch pad analysis in a numbered list. Do not include recommendations for any TRIVIAL problems. Explain exactly what specific changes you recommend. Make sure that these recommendations don't violate any of the Guidelines listed above. Use a header \"Recommendations\" for this section and order them with the most important recommendations first.\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n<h2>Thinking</h2>\r\n1. [problem description] ([Major, Moderate, Minor])\r\n2. ...\r\n3....\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n1. [specific recommendation here that clearly states what exactly should change and what it should be changed to]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeverity definitions:\r\n\r\n- MAJOR = blocks or misleads task completion; critical accessibility failure; structural breakdown.\r\n\r\n- MODERATE = meaning is intact but clarity/usability/readability is hindered; noticeable accessibility or structure issue.\r\n\r\n- MINOR = mimimal lack of clarity/usability/readability\r\n\r\n- TRIVIAL = polish, very low or questionable impact.\r\n\r\nAnalysis checklist (use as you read the page):\r\n\r\nPage intent & audience: infer primary user task(s); note if audiences are mixed (residents vs businesses).\r\n\r\nHeadings & structure: logical H1→H2→H3→H4→H5 order; one H1; scannable sections; no skipped heading levels.\r\n\r\nReadability: plain language, active voice, “you” voice; sentences ≲20 words; bullets for 3+ items.\r\n\r\nLinks: descriptive link text (no “click here”); avoid duplicate adjacent links\r\n\r\nData & dates: stale dates/events; time-sensitive info clearly labeled.\r\n\r\nBreadcrumb: the sequence of pages in the breadcrumb should make logical sense, starting with a broad subject area. Verify that each link in the breadcrumb is a logical subset of the prior link. If the breadcrumb has more than 5 links, think about ways to improve the structure that would reduce the number of links.\r\n\r\nGrounding rule:\r\nWhen noting a problem, reference the nearest section heading and include a short quoted fragment (less than 12 words) so recommendations are tied to real text.\r\n\r\nOutput (two sections only):\r\n\r\n<h2>Thinking</h2>\r\nNumbered list of MAJOR/MODERATE/MINOR/TRIVIAL problems you found (if none, say “No major or moderate problems found.”). For each item include:\r\n\r\nSeverity in (MAJOR/MODERATE/MINOR/TRIVIAL)\r\n\r\nArea (e.g., Headings, Link text, Alt text, Breadcrumb)\r\n\r\nNearest heading + short quote for grounding\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\nProvide only MAJOR, MODERATE, and MINOR fixes, ordered most important first, ≤12 items and ≤3000 characters total. Each item must include:\r\n\r\n[Severity] [Area] Change X → Y. Why: <one-sentence rationale>. Example: “<before>” → “<after>”. Impact: High/Med. Effort: Low/Med/High.\r\nUse explicit edits (what to change and what to change it to). If none, write: “No recommendations—no major or moderate issues identified.”\r\n\r\nSelf-audit before finalizing:\r\nRemove any TRIVIAL fixes from Recommendations; ensure nothing suggests external-link labels or unnecessary contact prominence; confirm breadcrumb advice matches policy; keep under 3000 chars.\r\n\r\nSample Output (format only)\r\n\r\n<h2>Thinking</h2>\r\n1. (MAJOR) Headings — “Application Process” section: hierarchy skips H2→H4; quote: “Apply online”.\r\n2. (MODERATE) Link text — “click here” under “Eligibility”; quote: “click here”.\r\n3. (MINOR) Long paragraph — “About the program”; quote: “The Department of…”.\r\n3. (TRIVIAL) Wording could be improved but not greatly.\r\n\r\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\r\n1. [MAJOR][Headings] Change “Application Process” subheads from H4 → H3. Why: fixes skipped levels for screen readers and scanning. Example: “How to apply (H4)” → “How to apply (H3)”. Impact: High. Effort: Low.\r\n2. [MODERATE][Link text] Replace “click here” with “Check eligibility requirements”. Why: improves accessibility and comprehension. Example: “click here” → “Check eligibility requirements”. Impact: Med. Effort: Low.\r\n3. [MINOR][Link text] Reword complex sentence. Why: improves accessibility and comprehension. Example: “...” → “...”. Impact: Minor. Effort: Low."
