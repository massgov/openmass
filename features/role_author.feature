Feature: Author Role
  As an author whose work needs approval before publication,
  I want a role to be able to create / edit certain kinds of content without the ability to publish
  so I can create the best content experience for the constituents of Massachusetts.

  Scenario: Verify that authors can only see content menu item
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "author" role
    And I am on "admin"
    Then I should not see the link "Manage" in the "toolbar" region
    Then I should see the link "Content" in the "toolbar" region

  Scenario: Verify that author does not have permission to change site code or administer users
    Then the "author" role should not have the permissions:
      | Permission                  |
      | administer modules          |
      | administer software updates |
      | administer themes           |
      | administer users            |

  Scenario: Verify that the author can access key pages
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "author" role
    And I am on "/user"

    And I should have access to "/node/add"

    And I should have access to "/node/add/org_page"
    And I should have access to "/node/add/service_page"
    And I should not have access to "/admin/people"
    And I should not have access to "/admin/ma-dash/needs-review"

  # Unpublished meaning in the context is for creating a new org page content
  Scenario: Verify that author can edit unpublished content, request review, but not publish
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "author" role
    And I am editing an unpublished "org_page" with the title "Behat Org Page"
