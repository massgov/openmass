Changed:
  - description: Allow Stacked Layout content type to be used as a parent for Info Details pages. Added stacked_layout to target_bundles in field.field.node.info_details.field_primary_parent. Added field_primary_parent to stacked_layout content type to enable proper breadcrumb generation and hierarchy integration. Changed sort field from field_executive_title to title (field_executive_title only exists on executive_order). Renamed content type from "Stacked layout (prototype)" to "Stacked layout - prototype" because Drupal's autocomplete extracts the last set of parentheses as the entity ID, causing validation errors when bundle labels contain parentheses.
