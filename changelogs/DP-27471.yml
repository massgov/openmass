      Backstop Reliability Fixes

      - Waits for alerts to have content before taking a screenshot
      - Fixes Caspio Form selector on pages which don't have a footer (i.e. the 404 page)
      - Splits the expansions of accordion toggle tests into emergency alerts and regular alerts
      - Refactor the logic for checking if accordions expand as expected
      - Tweaks engine options and passes an option to tell Puppeteer to wait for domcontentloaded before proceeding
      - Adds a backstop reference test to each pull request to verify that backstop can collect reference images successfully
