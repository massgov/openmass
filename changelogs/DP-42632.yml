Fixed:
  - description: |-
      Restore collection visibility for Authors and Editors by re-adding the "access taxonomy overview" permission that was removed in DP-39524. To prevent these roles from seeing the Taxonomy tab in the Content menu, created a new "access taxonomy dashboard menu" permission that controls visibility of the Taxonomy menu item separately from the ability to view taxonomy terms in entity reference fields.
    issue: DP-42632
